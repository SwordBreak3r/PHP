# PHP

This is a simple website built using PHP.

It focuses on adding records to a MySQL database, retreiving those records and deleting them.

I used XXAMP to host it locally as well as the MySQL DB.

This is a project that I used to learn PHP and how it works with a Database. It allows the user to create a custom RPG class using the email for the user who creates the class, the name of the class and the class abilities.

It was done by following a guide by NetNinja on the Stormwind website.
